 		<p> Hello All! I am originally from Istanbul, Turkey. I have been living in Austin for eight years now. I am currently teaching in Plan II Honors Program at The University of Texas at Austin (UT). In May 2016, I will graduate from UT with my Ph.D. in English and Comparative Literature. I have started learning how to code to complement my soft skills with technical ones and work in a position where I can employ both. In addition to studying and teaching, I love working out, particularly weight lifting, hiking, and road biking. </p>
